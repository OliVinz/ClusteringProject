Clustering project on a customer data set to cluster different groups of customers together.

Scenario

and then be able to address them more individually. For this purpose, 200 customers
Data collected on their gender, age, annual income (in T$) and willingness to spend (as
value between 1 and 100). Now the first groups are to be formed and their characteristics identified.
